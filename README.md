The features of the firmware are powerful and allow you to write a script that will run every time your camera powers up. 
This can also be combined with the CamDo Blink GoPro time-lapse controller. https://cam-do.com/products/blink-gopro-time-lapse-controller

Basic functionality via scripting that can be achieved:
- switch to a specified mode - change to any setting combination (over 50!)
- trigger the shutter button
- implement a delay
- turn wifi on
- turn wifi off
- WiFi enable monitor - fixes the wifi disable bug when USB data is plugged in
- put the camera into standby (leaves WiFi on if it was already on)
- turn the camera off (once you are finished)
- Video loop - loops taking vidoes of a specified time, deleting old footage as necessary to a configurable limit
- Upload images to dropbox
- Change the IP address of the GoPro camera
- Connect the camera as a CLIENT to your WiFi network, and then control the camera via REST commands from your browser
